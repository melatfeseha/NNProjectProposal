# Neural Networks for Geoguessr

## Project Description
I will focus on training neural networks using tagged images from across the globe to be able to identify specific locations given their images. I was interested in this as I'm curious to get insight into how images are synthesized and processed under a neural network, and what that learning process would look like. In terms of scope I have none, I would love to be able to accurately identify pictures from across the globe, but I know that might not be completely feasible given the time we have and the data sets we might have access to. 

In addition to this, I would also love to train a neural network to do the inverse task: generate an image of a location based on the name given. I think the idea/problem of image generation is interesting, and it might be interesting to correlate relationships between the two models (if there are any). I'm particularly interested to see how we would evaluate a model like this, since the success of this task seems more subjective, which could be the case when tried under fictional location names and places that don't exist. 

## Project Goals
1. Locate places around the globe accurately, without bias towards European/North American countries. 
2. Understand how spatial/image data is synthesized for information on locality.
3. Identify any relationships that exist between the two models, for model improvement or understanding their process and how they learn better. 

## Ethical Considerations
In thinking about the ethical considerations of this project and how it could be used maliciously, the first thing that comes to mind is finding out people's locations based on images they post on social media (for example) without their consent and using that to track them. It also might generate more disparaging and/or negative images for locations in the global South as a result of an overrepresentation of the West as industrialized and other countries as being more antiquated. These are things that we will have to think more consciously about when developing ideas on how to limit and negate the potential harm of these models.
