# Neural Networks Project Proposal
The website for my Neural Networks project proposal.

# Title: Geoguessr Using Neural Networks or maybe the opposite, generating images of places using only their name
insert:
Why I'm interested
What it should do and for what locations

insert image maybe?  

# Project Description
I will focus on training neural networks to be able to identify specific locations across the globe given their images. 

# Project Goals
Locate places around the globe accurately (might be easier for western nations)
understand how spatial/image data is synthecized for information
make a model that is not geographically biased towards the US and Europe ie can identify locations outside of those areas accurately


# Other Considerations
how this could be used maliciously very easily
mostly wanting to do this for personal interest in how spatial data might be categorized to locate pictures and maybe how a reverse image search would work
